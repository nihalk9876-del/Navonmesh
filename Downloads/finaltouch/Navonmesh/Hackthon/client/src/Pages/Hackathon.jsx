However, the traditional e-commerce Apps provide basic product information, and provide few angle images of products. These Apps cannot provide the depth of information and real time view of that product. When the goods are delivered to the consumer, then the consumer decides the suitability of the product. These goods often need to match the customers need and choice, if not suitable, they need to be returned through the troublesome return procedure. Furthermore, traditional e-commerce websites cannot provide real time Live sale assistance for helping the customers. Also, In present scenario of Ecommerce platform, the specifically the seller of apparels/ dress/ garments demonstrates either by 2D photographs or sketch & hence the buyer can only visualise , specifically the apparels / dress / garments but cannot get the idea that how dress suites to him / her . Also, majority of times the products gets returned due to improper size / fitting.`,
